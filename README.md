# discord_bot_todd
making a discord bot for some reason

## requiremnts
- discord.py library

## ideation
- this bot is just going to have a bunch of annoying and meaningless features like:
  - annoy: pings someone to tell them something really annoying out of a list of annoying sentences
  - mostenire: regurgitates a list of mostenire derivatives
  - add-mostenire: allows the user to add mostenire derivatives to the list
- we can come up with more nonsense features as we go

## learnings
- discord API
- decorators
- async programming
